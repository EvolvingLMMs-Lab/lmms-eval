# The Evaluation Suite of Large Multimodal Models 

> Accelerating the development of large multimodal models (LMMs) with `lmms-eval`

üè† [Homepage](https://lmms-lab.github.io/) |  üéâ [Blog](https://lmms-lab.github.io/lmms-eval-blog/lmms-eval-0.1/) | üìö [Documentation](docs/README.md) | ü§ó [Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/lmms-lab) | <a href="https://emoji.gg/emoji/1684-discord-thread"><img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/1684-discord-thread.png" width="14px" height="14px" alt="Discord_Thread"></a> [discord/lmms-eval](https://discord.gg/zdkwKUqrPy)


In today's world, we're on an exciting journey toward creating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), much like the enthusiasm of the 1960s moon landing. This journey is powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs), which are complex systems capable of understanding, learning, and performing a wide variety of human tasks. These advancements bring us closer to achieving AGI.

To gauge how advanced these models are, we use a variety of evaluation benchmarks. These benchmarks are tools that help us understand the capabilities of these models, showing us how close we are to achieving AGI. However, finding and using these benchmarks is a big challenge. The necessary benchmarks and datasets are spread out and hidden in various places like Google Drive, Dropbox, and different school and research lab websites. It feels like we're on a treasure hunt, but the maps are scattered everywhere.

In the field of language models, there has been a valuable precedent set by the work of [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). They offer integrated data and model interfaces, enabling rapid evaluation of language models and serving as the backend support framework for the [open-llm-leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), and has gradually become the underlying ecosystem of the era of foundation models.

However, though there are many new evaluation datasets are recently proposed, the efficient evaluation pipeline of LMM is still in its infancy, and there is no unified evaluation framework that can be used to evaluate LMM across a wide range of datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce **lmms-eval**, an evaluation framework meticulously crafted for consistent and efficient evaluation of LMM.

We humbly obsorbed the exquisite and efficient design of [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). Building upon its foundation, we implemented our `lmms-eval` framework with performance optimizations specifically for LMMs.

## Necessity of lmms-eval

We believe our effort could provide an efficient interface for the detailed comparison of publicly available models to discern their strengths and weaknesses. It's also useful for research institutions and production-oriented companies to accelerate the development of large multimodal models. With the `lmms-eval`, we have significantly accelerated the lifecycle of model iteration. Inside the LLaVA team, the utilization of `lmms-eval` largely improves the efficiency of the model development cycle, as we are able to evaluate weekly trained hundreds of checkpoints on 20-30 datasets, identifying the strengths and weaknesses, and then make targeted improvements.

# Annoucement

## Contribution Guidance

We've added guidance on contributing new datasets and models. Please refer to our [documentation](docs/README.md). If you need assistance, you can contact us via [discord/lmms-eval](https://discord.gg/ebAMGSsS).

## v0.1.0 Released

The first version of the `lmms-eval` is released. We are working on providing an one-command evaluation suite for accelerating the development of LMMs. 

> In [LLaVA Next](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-01-30-llava-next/) development, we internally utilize this suite to evaluate the multiple different model versions on various datasets. It significantly accelerates the model development cycle for it's easy integration and fast evaluation speed.

The main feature includes:

</p>

### One-command evaluation, with detailed logs and samples.
You can evaluate the models on multiple datasets with a single command. No model/data preparation is needed, just one command line, few minutes, and get the results. Not just a result number, but also the detailed logs and samples, including the model args, input question, model response, and ground truth answer.

```python
# Evaluating LLaVA on multiple datasets
accelerate launch --num_processes=8 -m lmms_eval --model llava   --model_args pretrained="liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b"   --tasks mme,mmbench_en --batch_size 1 --log_samples --log_samples_suffix llava_v1.5_mme_mmbenchen --output_path ./logs/ #
```

### Accelerator support and Tasks grouping.
We support the usage of `accelerate` to wrap the model for distributed evaluation, supporting multi-gpu and tensor parallelism. With **Task Grouping**, all instances from all tasks are grouped and evaluated in parallel, which significantly improves the throughput of the evaluation. After evaluation, all instances are sent to postprocessing module for metric calcuations and potential GPT4-eval queries.

Below are the total runtime on different datasets using 4 x A100 40G.

| Dataset (#num)          | LLaVA-v1.5-7b      | LLaVA-v1.5-13b     |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| mme (2374)              | 2 mins 43 seconds  | 3 mins 27 seconds  |
| gqa (12578)             | 10 mins 43 seconds | 14 mins 23 seconds |
| scienceqa_img (2017)    | 1 mins 58 seconds  | 2 mins 52 seconds  |
| ai2d (3088)             | 3 mins 17 seconds  | 4 mins 12 seconds  |
| coco2017_cap_val (5000) | 14 mins 13 seconds | 19 mins 58 seconds |

### All-In-One HF dataset hubs.

We are hosting more than 40 (and increasing) datasets on [huggingface/lmms-lab](https://huggingface.co/lmms-lab), we carefully converted these datasets from original sources and included all variants, versions and splits. Now they can be directly accessed without any burden of data preprocessing. They also serve for the purpose of visualizing the data and grasping the sense of evaluation tasks distribution.

# Installation

For formal usage, you can install the package from PyPI by running the following command:
```bash
pip install lmms-eval
```

For development, you can install the package by cloning the repository and running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval
cd lmms-eval
pip install -e .
```

If you wanted to test llava, you will have to clone their repo from [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) and
```
git clone https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA
cd LLaVA
pip install -e .
```

You can check the [environment install script](miscs/repr_scripts.sh) and [torch environment info](miscs/repr_torch_envs.txt) to **reproduce LLaVA-1.5's paper results**. We found torch/cuda versions difference would cause small variations in the results, we provide the [results check](miscs/llava_result_check.md) with different environments.

If you want to test on caption dataset such as `coco`, `refcoco`, and `nocaps`, you will need to have `java==1.8.0 ` to let pycocoeval api to work. If you don't have it, you can install by using conda
```
conda install openjdk=8
```
you can then check your java version by `java -version`

# Add Customized Model and Dataset

lmms_eval is a fork of [lm-eval-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). We recommend you to read through the [docs of lm-eval-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/docs) for relevant information. 

Below are the changes we made to the original API:
- Build context now only pass in idx and process image and doc during the model responding phase. This is due to the fact that dataset now contains lots of images and we can't store them in the doc like the original lm-eval-harness other wise the cpu memory would explode.
- Instance.args (lmms_eval/api/instance.py) now contains a list of images to be inputted to lmms.
- lm-eval-harness supports all HF language models as single model class. Currently this is not possible of lmms because the input/output format of lmms in HF are not yet unified. Thererfore, we have to create a new class for each lmms model. This is not ideal and we will try to unify them in the future.
