    "refer_desc":  {"role": "Assistant", "prompt": "We would like to request your feedback on the performance of two AI assistants in response to the user question displayed above. The user asks the question about specific region of an image. For your reference, the visual content in the image is represented with five descriptive sentences describing the same image. In addition, specific object locations within the image are given, along with detailed coordinates. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y. Also, the relationships between pairs of objects are provided, in the format of object -> relationship -> subject, where the object/subject are indexed by object id from previous object lists as well as the object names. Also, several region description are given, each describing a box region of image, with detailed coordinates. \nPlease rate the spatial correspondence, helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, level of details of their responses. Each assistant receives an overall score on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher score indicates better overall performance.\nPlease first output a single line containing only two values indicating the scores for Assistant 1 and 2, respectively. The two scores are separated by a space.\nIn the subsequent line, please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented does not affect your judgment."},

Specifically, pay your attention to the precision of the coordinates and whether it matches the object. Small deviation (<20% of ground-truth box width or height) of coordinates is allowed and shouldn't be punished. More than that, the degree of deviation should be reflected in scoring too.
