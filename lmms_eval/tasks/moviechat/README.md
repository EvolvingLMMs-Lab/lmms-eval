# MovieChat-1K

## Task Description

This repository contains an evaluation dataset designed for assessing the long video understanding performance of video models. The dataset includes human-generated question-answer pairs for the video both in global mode and breakpoint mode. The evaluation focuses on multiple dimensions of the responses generated by GPT-3.5.

- GPT-3.5 Evaluation: The answers are evaluated using the prompts designed by Video-ChatGPT, which rates the responses based on the aforementioned dimensions with `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`.
