| 9-10 | No Omissions: - Covers all key points and supplementary details of the question, achieving 100% completeness. - In addition to fully answering the question, the response includes extra relevant information or advanced analysis. - The structure is rigorous and logical, providing a holistic and in-depth understanding for the reader. |

# Example Evaluations

## Example 1
### Input
- **Question**: What are the main advantages of active learning over passive learning?
- **Generated Answer**: Active learning engages students more effectively than passive learning.
- **Reference Material**: According to the textbook, active learning has been proven to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention, outperforming passive learning methods.

### Output
```json
{
  "reasoning_steps": "The reference material explicitly states that active learning enhances engagement and knowledge retention, supporting the generated answer’s claim that active learning engages students more effectively. The supporting excerpt is: ‘Active learning has been proven to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention.’ The generated answer aligns well with the supporting excerpt and does not introduce unrelated information.",
  "output_comments": "The answer is accurate and aligns with the core concept in the reference material, with a logical argument. However, it lacks further explanation of how active learning enhances engagement, such as specific methods or case studies. Adding examples like classroom discussions or group collaboration could strengthen the argument.",
  "correctness_label": "Perfect",
  "richness_score": 5,
  "richness_comments": "While the answer is correct, it only presents the most basic concept without extending background knowledge or examples, such as comparisons between different learning methods or supporting data. Including research cases or data would improve richness.",
  "completeness_score": 6,
  "completeness_comments": "The answer covers the main key points but has room for improvement. For example, it could elaborate on specific learning scenarios or contrasts with traditional passive learning methods for a more comprehensive response."
}
```

## Example 2
### Input
- **Question**: What benefits does photosynthesis provide to plants?
- **Generated Answer**: Photosynthesis provides oxygen for plants.
- **Reference Material**: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, which serves as the energy source for plant growth.

### Output
```json
{
  "reasoning_steps": "The reference material states that photosynthesis primarily converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, which fuels plant growth. The supporting excerpt is: ‘Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, which serves as the energy source for plant growth.’ However, the generated answer incorrectly attributes the main function of photosynthesis to oxygen production, overlooking its core role in energy conversion.",
  "output_comments": "The answer is incorrect because it fails to reflect the core function of photosynthesis as described in the reference material. Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, not its primary contribution. The answer should refocus on how plants obtain energy through photosynthesis.",
  "correctness_label": "Incorrect",
  "richness_score": 2,
  "richness_comments": "The response is incorrect and lacks supporting details such as the photosynthetic process, influencing factors, or scientific explanations. Additional information on ATP synthesis or chlorophyll’s role in absorbing light would enhance richness.",
  "completeness_score": 2,
  "completeness_comments": "The answer fails to address the key aspects of the question, lacking an explanation of how photosynthesis supports plant growth. A full explanation should include the energy conversion process and glucose’s role in growth."
