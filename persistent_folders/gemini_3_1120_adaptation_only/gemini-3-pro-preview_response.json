{"video_mmmu_adaptation_question_only___test___0": "Based on the chemical structure shown in the image:\n\n1.  **Identify the functional group:** The top carbon atom (C1) is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to a hydrogen atom ($H-C=O$). This functional group is an **aldehyde**.\n2.  **Classify the sugar:** Monosaccharides containing an aldehyde group are classified as **aldoses**. (Those with a ketone group are called ketoses).\n3.  **Specific Identification:** The molecule has 6 carbons and the specific arrangement of hydroxyl (-OH) groups (Right-Left-Right-Right) identifies it as **D-glucose**.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks \"What kind of sugar is this, **aldose or ketose**?\". This phrasing directs you to choose the general classification.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is **A. aldose**."}
