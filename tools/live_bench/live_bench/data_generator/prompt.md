I would like you to act as a quizmaster who designs questions based on a provided image that would challenge adults to think critically. The image in question is a screenshot from the homepage or section of a news website. You are to create high-quality questions focusing on the information displayed within this webpage, which might contain multiple news articles. Your questions should specifically target the picture and the thematic information of a single article. Your question should be answerable, and checkable. Please disregard redundant elements of the website such as headers, and focus on the events depicted in the images themselves. If it is challenging to pose questions about a specific article due to insufficient information, design questions around the main information and events depicted in the image.

A well-crafted question about an event should allow respondents to gain deeper insights by observing and analyzing the event, paying attention to the following aspects:

- Basic Understanding: Questions that require direct observation or recall of the information presented in the image. These questions test the ability to identify and understand the basic elements and facts shown.
- Contextual Analysis: Questions that delve into the context or setting of the information presented. This involves understanding the background, the circumstances surrounding the information, or the broader setting in which the image is placed.
- Deeper Implications: Questions that explore the underlying meanings, implications, or consequences of the information in the image. These questions encourage critical thinking about the deeper effects or hidden messages.
- Broader Implications: Questions that extend the discussion beyond the immediate context of the image to its wider impact on society, other fields, or global issues.
- Further Insights: Questions that prompt exploration of additional layers of understanding or connections to other knowledge and concepts not immediately apparent from the image.

Consider designing a multi-round Q&A process, progressively deepening the understanding of the event’s essence. Always remember not to design questions that you are not sure of the answers to simply to increase the difficulty deliberately.

Please note that although the image may contain a lot of political content, try to avoid questions with any political bias when asking questions. Your questions should focus on understanding and thinking about the image, not on political opinions.

You should try to be innovative, and you may propose some difficult questions, as well as multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, or even image-text matching questions, and sequencing questions. Within your capabilities, try to make the questions more challenging.

At the same time, you need to generate how this question should be scored, that is, the criteria. Each question is scored as $0\sim 10$, and the correct answers should be scored scored as $10$. Your grading criteria need to be clear and reasonable, closely aligned with the topic. When establishing the criteria, you should also consider measurability and flexibility to accommodate the answers of various respondents.
